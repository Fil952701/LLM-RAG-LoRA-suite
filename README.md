**LLM-RAG-LoRA Suite for Titanka Suite AI 🚀**


**Proprietary – All Rights Reserved**
A production-oriented toolkit that powers offer & newsletter generation and promotion recommendations based on historical performance data. When the system detects a red period (under-performance), it suggests actions and drafts content that’s grounded in your brand knowledge.


**✨ Highlights**
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Generates copy grounded in brand guidelines, product facts, and past campaign results.
LoRA Personalization: Lightweight adapters tailor tone & style to each brand without full model retraining.
Red-Period Detection: Seasonality-aware analytics flag downturns and trigger targeted promos.
Offer & Newsletter Composer: Multivariate offers, subject lines, CTAs, and segments—ready to ship.
Promotion Recommender: “Promote / Don’t promote” with rationale, uplift expectations, and a mini-checklist.
Guardrails & Compliance: Price floors/ceilings, exclusions, grounded references, and hallucination checks.
Observability: Traces for retrieval hits, scores, and model decisions for auditability and continuous improvement.


**🧠 What This Suite Does**
Understands your portfolio & history via indexing of product data, brand rules, and past performance.
Detects when you’re in the red and why (e.g., channel fatigue, seasonal patterns, price pressure).
Generates offers & newsletters that cite the data they used (via retrieval snippets) and adhere to policy.
Advises when to promote, where, and how—including cadence, channel mix, and targeting hints.


**🧩 How It Works (High-Level)**
**Ingest & Index 📚**
Structured unstructured sources (catalog, promos, brand voice, KPIs) are chunked and embedded for hybrid search.
**Detect Red Periods 🔴**
Rolling windows + seasonal baselines + anomaly scoring surface downturns (per brand, segment, and channel).
**Retrieve & Ground 🔎**
The most relevant facts are retrieved with confidence scores; low-confidence contexts are discarded or re-queried.
**Generate With LoRA ✍️**
A LoRA-adapted LLM drafts offers/newsletters in your brand voice, referencing retrieved facts.
**Validate & Rank ✅**
Outputs are checked against business rules (floors, exclusions, tone), then ranked by clarity & relevance.
**Recommend Action 📈**
The system emits “promote now / wait”, rationale, expected uplift bands, and a concise execution checklist.


**📉 Red-Period Detection (Concepts)**
Signals: CTR, CVR, AOV, revenue, margin, return/cancel rates, list health (engagement/complaints), inventory.
Baselines: Seasonality-aware moving averages (Hodrick-Prescott/Prophet-style), holiday/event adjustments.
Alerts: Multi-metric composite score (z-score + robust stats) → red/amber/green.
Attribution Hints: Channel fatigue, creative decay, audience saturation, competitive pricing.


**🧷 RAG: Grounded Content, Not Guesswork**
Hybrid Retrieval: Dense + lexical scoring; per-chunk freshness & authority weights.
Confidence Controls: Minimum retrieval score, diversity penalties, contradiction checks.
Grounding in Output: Optional inline citations or footnotes to retrieved snippets.


**🎛️ LoRA Personalization**
Why LoRA: Brand-grade tuning with tiny adapters—fast, cheap, reversible.
What We Tune: Tone, jargon, style constraints; call-to-action patterns; compliance phrasing.
Safe Rollback: Swap adapters per brand/segment; keep the base model pristine.


**🗳️ Promotion Recommender**
Decision: Promote Now / Hold (+ confidence).
Rationale: Key metrics that drove the decision (e.g., “CTR −22% vs seasonal baseline”).
Uplift Range: Conservative / expected / optimistic bands.
Checklist: Audience(s), channels, offer depth, cadence, and timing window.


**🛡️ Quality, Safety & Governance**
Hallucination Controls: Retrieval thresholds, completeness checks, and “abstain” pathways.
Policy Engine: Price floors/ceilings, product exclusions, age-restricted rules, fairness & tone checks.
Audit Trails: Store prompt, retrieval set, scores, final output, and policy validations.
Privacy: Customer data remains within controlled storage boundaries; no unauthorized sharing.


**📏 Evaluation & KPIs**
Offline: ROUGE/BLEU for copy consistency, groundedness score, policy-violation rate, retrieval precision/recall.
Online: Lift in CTR/CVR/AOV, revenue vs. baseline, unsubscribe/complaint rate, lead indicators for list health.
Detector Quality: Precision/Recall on red-period flags; mean time-to-detect; false-alert rate.


**🗺️ Roadmap**
📦 Offer Simulator: Expected margin impact & sell-through modeling.
🪄 Adaptive LoRA: Auto-curate adapters from winning copy variants.
🔁 Active Learning: Human edits loop back to retrievers and adapters.
🧮 Causal Insights: Uplift modeling to separate correlation from causation.
🔐 Pipelines QA: End-to-end tests for groundedness and policy adherence.
